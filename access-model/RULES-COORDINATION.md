# ⚠️ READ FIRST — Firebase rules are ONE shared document

All apps in the `philinity-893d2` project (autoflag, taskboard, veritas, eats,
command_center, philinity, foodswipe, users, config) share a **single** RTDB
rules document. Publishing rules for one app **republishes the whole thing**.

If two app-bots each build "the rules" from their own starting point, **whoever
publishes last wins and silently reverts the other's work.**

## Rules every app-bot MUST follow

1. **Start from the CURRENT live rules.** Before editing, copy the latest rules
   straight from the Firebase console (Realtime Database → Rules). Do NOT build
   from a spec file's snippet or an old copy — those go stale the moment another
   app is hardened.
2. **Change ONLY your own app's block.** Leave every other app's block
   byte-for-byte identical. You are editing one top-level key (e.g. `veritas`),
   nothing else.
3. **Sequence, don't parallelize.** Finish and publish one app's rollout before
   starting the next. Two rollouts editing the shared rules at the same time will
   clobber each other.
4. **Keep the lockout-proof root UIDs** consistent (`CuJigrzCbRfFFsM7uqe0mix46xH3`
   and, where applicable, `g4stabGPKiWAE23NTw6oUsqawWf1`).
5. **Back up before publishing** — copy the current rules to a file first, so
   rollback is instant.

## Current state (update this as apps are hardened)

| App | Rules state | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| autoflag | ✅ hardened (role-based, per-customer isolation) | Pieces 1–3 done |
| veritas | ✅ fully hardened + DEPLOYED 2026-05-31 | role-based (admin/moderator/user). people/categories/acknowledged + per-session ownership all live & verified against console. `sessions/$sid` write = author (`createdBy.uid`) or mod/root. Client Rev 6.17 |
| taskboard | 🛠 rules ready in PIECE3 (PR) — pending console deploy | role-based (admin/moderator/user). Roster at **`taskboard/access/{emailKey}`** (NOT `taskboard/people`, which is assignee names). `taskboard/tasks` is a keyed map: members write `tasks/$taskId`, but a write at the `tasks` parent (destructive Import) is admin-only. Client Rev 6.6. Deploy PIECE3 + seed roster + probe-verify, then mark DEPLOYED. |
| orbit | 🛠 rules ready in PIECE3 (PR) — pending console deploy | role-based (admin/moderator/user), shared (no per-user data isolation). Roster at **`orbit/people/{emailKey}`**. `orbit/people` admin-write + own-record read; `orbit/history` (access-activity log) members-read / admin-write. Client Rev 1.0 (Google + email/password, People/Data/History shell). Deploy CLIENT → verify → PIECE3, seed roster, probe-verify, then mark DEPLOYED. |
| eats | 🔒 root-UID only | safe; harden when it gets real users |
| command_center | 🔒 root-UID only | safe; harden when it gets real users |
| philinity | 🔒 root-UID only | safe; harden when it gets real users |
| foodswipe | 🔒 root-UID only | safe; harden when it gets real users |
| users / config | ✅ per-user private / locked | unchanged |
